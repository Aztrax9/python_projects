# 🔄 For & While Loop Operations

This is a collection of beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate how to use **for loops** and **while loops** to create patterns and perform iterative tasks. Perfect for learning nested loops, alignment, and dynamic input handling.

Each script runs in a single file and takes user input to print structured patterns like stars, numbers, and also includes a real-life utility like a bill totaler.

## 📌 Features

### ✔️ Programs Included:

- **Star Pattern (Left-Aligned)**  
  Prints a left-aligned right-angled triangle using `*` symbols.

- **Number Pattern (Increasing Order)**  
  Prints incremental sequences starting from 1 on each row.

- **Decreasing Number Pattern**  
  Prints repeated numbers in decreasing order (starting from 5).

- **Number Pyramid (Centered)**  
  Prints a centered number pyramid pattern with proper spacing.

- **Star Pyramid (Centered)**  
  Prints a pyramid of stars with center alignment.

- **Wide Pyramid Number Pattern**  
  Prints a centered pyramid with extra spacing for alignment.
