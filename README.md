# 🐍 python_projects

Welcome to my personal collection of Python projects!  
This repository is a learning archive where I apply and expand my Python knowledge by working on different mini-projects and challenges. I’ll be updating it regularly as I continue to explore new concepts.

## 📁 Current Projects

Here's a list of the folders/projects included so far:

### 1️⃣ bill_generator
> A simple Python program to create itemized bills. Great for practicing input/output operations and string formatting.

### 2️⃣ triangle_calculator
> Calculates the type and properties of triangles based on user input. Focuses on conditionals and mathematical logic.

### 3️⃣ equality_checker_&_others
> A collection of beginner-level Python scripts to check equality, compare values, and more. Explores logical operators and basic flow control.

### 4️⃣ turtle_design_&_others
> Fun projects using Python's `turtle` graphics module. Good for practicing loops, colors, and basic geometry.

### 5️⃣ for_and_while_loop_operations
> Contains Python programs that demonstrate the use of `for` and `while` loops through small tasks and operations.

## 🛠 How to Run

All the projects are written in Python and formatted as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`).  
You can open them locally using:

1. **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**  
2. **VS Code** with the Jupyter extension  
3. **Google Colab** (just upload the notebook)
