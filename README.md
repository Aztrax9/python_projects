## 📁 Current Projects

Here's a list of the folders/projects included so far:

### 1️⃣ bill_generator
> A simple Python program to create itemized bills. Great for practicing input/output operations and string formatting.

### 2️⃣ triangle_calculator
> Calculates the type and properties of triangles based on user input. Focuses on conditionals and mathematical logic.

### 3️⃣ equality_checker_&_others
>A collection of beginner-friendly Python programs that include checking equality between numbers, identifying the greatest, generating multiplication tables, summing natural numbers, classifying even/odd numbers, and basic iteration. Perfect for mastering conditional logic, loops, and user input in Python.

### 4️⃣ turtle_design_&_others
> A mix of visually creative `turtle` graphics and beginner-level Python loop exercises. Includes artistic circle-square `turtle` designs with dots, structured loop outputs, and dynamic multiplication tables. Great for learning graphical programming, nested loops, and range-based iteration.

### 5️⃣ for_and_while_loop_operations
> Contains Python programs that demonstrate the use of `for` and `while` loops through small tasks and operations.

## 🛠 How to Run

All the projects are written in Python and formatted as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`).  
You can open them locally using:

1. **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**  
2. **VS Code** with the Jupyter extension  
3. **Google Colab** (just upload the notebook)
