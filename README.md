## 🛠 How to Run

- All the projects can be found in their respectively named folders. Each one of them contain the code and a ``readme.md`` file to help you guys understand what     the project does!

- All the projects, so far, are written in Python and formatted as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`).  
- You can open them locally by copying the code into your preferred IDLE (Integrated Development Learning Environment) and running it!
