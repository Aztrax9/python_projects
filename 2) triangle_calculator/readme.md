# 📐 Triangle Calculator

This is a simple **Python-based triangle calculator** that takes input for the three sides and three angles of a triangle, checks whether they form a valid triangle, and then classifies it as **Equilateral**, **Isosceles**, or **Scalene** based on the inputs.


## 📌 Features

- User input for:
  - 3 side lengths
  - 3 internal angles (in degrees)
- Validation of:
  - Triangle angle sum (should be exactly 180°)
  - Triangle inequality rule (sum of any two sides > third side)
- Classification into:
  - Equilateral triangle
  - Isosceles triangle
  - Scalene triangle


## 🛠 How to Run

### 🖥 Requirements:
- Python 3.x

### ▶️ Run the script:
```bash
python triangle_calculator.py
```

## ✏️ Remark:
- Make sure the sides and angles follow triangle rules:
  - Angles sum up to exactly 180°.
  - Each side must be less than the sum of the other two.
