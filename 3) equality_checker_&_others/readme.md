# 🧮 Equality Checker & Other Programs

This is a collection of beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate basic concepts like conditional statements, loops, arithmetic operations, and input handling.

Each script runs in a single file and takes user input to perform logic-based computations such as checking equality, calculating electricity bills, generating multiplication tables, and more.


## 📌 Features

### ✔️ Programs Included:

- **Equality Checker**  
  Checks if three numbers are equal, pairwise equal, or which number is greatest.

- **Electricity Bill Generator**  
  Calculates your electricity bill based on the number of units used, with tiered pricing and a surcharge.

- **Iterator**  
  Prints numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop.

- **Even or Odd Numbers**  
  Prints whether each number from 1 to `n` is even or odd.

- **Sum of First 'n' Natural Numbers**  
  Adds numbers from 1 to `n` using a loop.

- **Multiplication Table (fixed till 10)**  
  Generates the multiplication table of a number from 1 to 10.

- **Multiplication Table (custom limit)**  
  Generates a multiplication table up to a user-defined multiplier.

## 🛠 How to Run

### 🖥 Requirements:
- Python 3.x

### ▶️ Run the script:
- Copy the code into your preferred IDLE or online editor and run it!


## ✏️ Remark
- Make sure the sides and angles follow triangle rules:
  - Angles sum up to exactly 180°.
  - Each side must be less than the sum of the other two.
